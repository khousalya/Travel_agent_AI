Planning a trip should be exciting—but for many people, it quickly becomes overwhelming. From choosing the right destination to juggling flights, hotel options, daily itineraries, and unpredictable weather, the entire process can feel more like a chore than a joy.
People often spend hours searching through websites, comparing prices, reading reviews, and trying to build the perfect plan that fits their budget and preferences. Even then, last-minute changes or missing information can throw everything off.
